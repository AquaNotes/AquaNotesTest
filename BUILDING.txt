You can use ant, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or pretty much any IDE
to compile the app. Before building, you should ensure that:

1) You've read `libs/readme.txt' and have places the necessary
   JARs into the `libs' directory.

2) Your Eclipse/IDEA/ant/etc. project targets API level 13 or
   higher.

Forgetting to do either of these will result in compile errors.
